# BFS (Breadth-First Search) 🖇️ :

Explores nodes level by level, starting from the initial node.
Suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs or searching in graphs with multiple solutions.
Guarantees the shortest path when searching in unweighted graphs.
Well-suited for scenarios where the goal is to reach a target node with the fewest steps.
Requires more memory to store the queue of nodes to be explored.
Typically implemented using a queue data structure.
Better for scenarios like the "lem-in" project, where ants need to move through a colony's rooms and tunnels efficiently while avoiding traffic jams.

# DFS (Depth-First Search) 🖇️:

Explores nodes deeply, moving along a path until it reaches a leaf node before backtracking.
Can be faster than BFS in certain cases and requires less memory as it explores deeply before backtracking.
Suitable for finding paths, exploring all possibilities, and backtracking.
May not guarantee the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
Can get stuck in infinite loops if not implemented carefully.
Typically implemented using recursion or a stack data structure.
Better for scenarios where the specific path is more important than the shortest path, such as exploring all possible paths or traversing a tree-like structure.
In the context of the "lem-in" project, where the goal is to move ants efficiently through a colony's rooms and tunnels while finding the shortest path, BFS is a better choice. It ensures that the ants reach the target room with the fewest moves, handles multiple ants moving simultaneously, and avoids traffic jams.
